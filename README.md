# Usage
**Make an [iCloud/iTunes backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) before using odysseyn1x, so that you can go back if something goes wrong.**

The `amd64` iso is for 64-bit CPUs (AMD and Intel) and the `i686` one is for 32-bit CPUs. If you are unsure which one to download, the `amd64` ISO will work in most cases.

1. Download an `.iso` [here](https://github.com/raspberryenvoie/odysseyn1x/releases).
2. Download [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). If you prefer Rufus, make sure to select GPT partition and DD image mode otherwise it won't work.
3. Open balenaEtcher and write the `.iso` you downloaded to your USB drive.
4. Reboot, enter your BIOS's boot menu and select the USB drive.

# Odysseyra1n
## What's odysseyra1n
Odysseyra1n lets you install on a checkra1ned device
- libhooker, a substrate/substitute alternative built from the ground up by Coolstar with speed and stability in mind,
- Procursus, an open source and modern bootstrap that aims to provide a large set of consistently up-to-date tools and
- Sileo instead of aging Cydia.

## Installing odysseyra1n
1. If you're already jailbroken, restore system using the ckeckra1n app.
2. Jailbreak using checkra1n, but don’t open the ckeckra1n app.
3. Install odysseyra1n.

Note: You don’t have to reinstall odysseyra1n after each reboot, just re-jailbreak using checkra1n.

# Project Sandcastle
## What's Project Sandcastle
It's Android and Linux for the iPhone. Project Sandcastle is in beta so not everything is fully supported. [More information](https://projectsandcastle.org)

## Installing Android
Select `Project Sandcastle` > `Setup Project Sandcastle`. After that choose `Start Android`.

Note: Once Project Sandcastle is installed, simply choose `Start Android` to boot back into Android.

## Removing Android to reclaim space
1. Login via SSH to your checkra1ned device (odysseyn1x has a feature for that) or use a terminal app (e.g. Newterm)
2. Run `ls /dev/disk0s1s*` and find the last volume. You can verify it's the right volume by running `/System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/apfs.util -p VOLUME_HERE` and if it says Android, that's the correct one.
3. Once you have the volume path, you can then run these commands as root (type `su`):
```
mkdir -p /tmp/mnt
mount -t apfs VOLUME_HERE /tmp/mnt
rm -rf /tmp/mnt/nand
umount /tmp/mnt
sync
```

## Booting Linux
Select `Project Sandcastle` > `Start Linux`.

# Building odysseyn1x

To change the version of checkra1n, edit `CRSOURCE_amd64` and `CRSOURCE_i686`.\
Execute these commands on a Debian-based system.
```
git clone https://github.com/raspberryenvoie/odysseyn1x.git
cd odysseyn1x
sudo ./build.sh
```
